			style="width:200px;height:200px;">
<h3>Summary: </h3>
<p>The story begins off with a fellow who is forty years old, hitched to his spouse of 15 a long time that he now not is exceptionally associated with, and two kids who he scarcely sees. <br>And a boring work where he makes approximately 40K as a deals rep. His car breaks down on his way to a deals assembly. <br>He didn’t have a phone so he strolled to the closest house. This house had a expansive brick and fashioned press fence extended at slightest 500 feet along the roadside. <br>And the gate was at slightest 10 feet tall. Behind the gate was a house that was well over 10,000 square feet. It was white ranch fashion domestic that had twelve two-story columns over the front which made sense since the sign at the side of the entryway said “Twelve Pillars”. <br>He runs into an old man who was a bout 70 a long time ancient in an overalls. The man inquired in case he may offer assistance to him.<br>
</p>The man takes him to this garage and they begin talking. The old man imagines that he doesn’t claim the home, which you discover out afterward within the story that he does. <br>Instep he tells the fellow that he is the yard guy for the exceptionally affluent man who possesses the enormous house. They begin a relationship where the deals rep comes by and meets with the old man for months and each week that he comes back to meet with the old fellow the old man instructs the deals fellow a rule of the twelve pillars. <br>So it could be a story with a capable message weaved in.</p> 

<p> I remembered pillar 1-6 during my read and ill mention them and what they said to me.</p>
<ul><li><h3>Pillar 1</h3></li></ul>
<p> The only way things are going to change for you is when you change.</p>
<p> A lot of people think working hard is the key to success, and it is, but it is only one piece of the success puzzle.  For you to get a better job, with more money, and more opportunity, you must increase your skill set.  Which requires you to change your thoughts, your actions, and what you do everyday.
The conversations between the two of them are deep and every sentence has a pearl of wisdom.</p>
<ul><li><h3>Pillar 2</h3></li></ul>
<p> You should make sure that the outside of you is a good reflection of the inside of you.</p>
<p>Pillar number two is total well-being.  The body is made up of three parts: the body, soul, and the spirit.  You have to give equal attention to all three to have a healthy overall well-being.</p>
<ul><li><h3>Pillar 3</h3></li></ul>
<p>Time, effort, and imagination must be summoned constantly to keep any relationships flourishing and growing.</p>
<p>The old man inquires the deals fellow to tell him around his family. He tells him almost his battles to discover the time to spend with his family which his relationship with his spouse may be superior. The message is that we must cultivate any and all relationship that's vital to us. Similar to a cultivate it requires steady upkeep to keep the weeds out. On the off chance that you don’t weed for a couple of weeks, what happens to a plant? It doesn’t take much time and the weeds will take over. It is no diverse for our connections with our family, companions, and colleagues. Upkeep of a plant is simpler than beginning all over once more.</p>
<ul><li><h3>Pillar 4</h3></li></ul>
<p>The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it.</p>
<p>Objective setting is choosing where you need to go and after that planning a arrange to induce you there. Setting objectives that extend you and make you are doing things in an unexpected way is what will lead you to a future that you just need. Don’t hold up for individuals to set objectives for you.</p>
<ul><li><h3>Pillar 5</h3></li></ul>
<p>Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.</p>
<p>We all must endure from one of two torments: the torment of teach or the torment of lament. The contrast is that teach weighs ounces and lament weights tons. Your best opportunity each day are those that adjust together with your by and large objectives and ought to be what you spend your time on. Don’t fair go through the day, get from the day. Don’t spend you time on critical, spend your time on what is vital. We must be our claim creator of our lives.</p>
<ul><li><h3>Pillar 6</h3></li></ul>
<p>Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high.</p>
<p>Inquire yourself these questions: Who am I around? What impact are they having on me? What have they got me perusing? What have they got me saying? Where do they have me going? What do they have me considering? And most vitally, what do they have me getting to be? At that point inquire yourself the ultimate address: is that okay? Friends of comfort. This can be an interesting concept. Is it less demanding to keep certain people for companions, rather than seeking after unused companions. Fruitful individuals explore for connections
 with other fruitful individuals who will thrust them, challenge them, and energize them to gotten to be superior. To pull in appealing individuals, you must be appealing. Not physically but rationally and who you are. Your demeanor is enormously impacted by the individuals who you relate with.</p>
